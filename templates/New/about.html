                            The main difference between staffing and recruitment is that recruiting means looking and appealing to potential candidates for employment. Candidates go through a selection process, therefore applying for the position, and ultimately deciding if they accept it or not. Companies can complete this process internally, but usually, they hire recruitment agencies.
                            On the other hand, staffing is a practice of employing and increasing the workforce of a company. In this process, candidates apply for the job positions by themselves. Subsequently, staffing agencies pair these applicants with the right work offers, beneficiating both the employer and employee.

                            Hiring temporary staffing is an easy process. Usually, recruitment agencies near you provide these services. These companies will provide you with hassle-free staffing solutions that can cover your business needs. First, with the help of an employment agency, you will build an outline of the job opening. Subsequently, establishing the role of the worker's responsibilities.
